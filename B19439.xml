            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas the King our Soveraign Lord, upon some Decrease of the Plague in the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> and places adjacent, and probable hopes it might cease, with colder weather, did Command the next <hi>Hillary</hi> Term to be held at <hi>Westminster,</hi> as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; thereby intending Relief and Encouragement to His People in those parts, which he much desireth. But finding the Contagion hath continued there all this Winter-season; and although by the mercy of God it is in a great measure abated, yet doth still continue; and considering the confluence of fresh people, which the Term will bring thither, and their lodging in places, and conversing with persons that have been Infected, may be a means to spread and prolong the Infection: His Majesty therefore for avoiding that occasion, and for the future welfare and safety of His People, is pleased to adjourn part of the Term of St. <hi>Hillary</hi> now next coming; (That is to say) in and from the first Return thereof, called <hi>Octabis Hillarii,</hi> unto the third Return of the same Term, called <hi>Crastino Purificationis,</hi> from <hi>Westminster</hi> to the Castle of <hi>Windsor,</hi> and there to be held and continued for the residue of the said Term: Which His Majesty signifieth to all His loving Subjects of this Realm, to the intent they which have Cause or Commandment to appear in any of His Highness Courts at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in, or at any day or time, in or after the said <hi>Octabis Hillarii,</hi> may tarry at their dwellings, or where their business otherwise shall lie, without resorting to any of the said Courts for that cause, before the said <hi>Crastino Purificationis</hi> next coming, and that without danger, forfeiture, or penalty, or contempt, to incur to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards His Majesty in that behalf. And nevertheless His Majesties Pleasure is, That according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient order of the Laws, the Essoynes of the said <hi>Octabis Hillarii</hi> shall be kept; at which time Writs of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment (which His Majesty hereby commandeth the Lord High Chancellour of <hi>England</hi> to make forth) shall be directed to the Iustices of either Bench, and to the Iudges of all other His Majesties Courts, to whom like Writs have been usually directed, giving them power to Adjourn the next <hi>Hillary</hi> Term, in and from <hi>Octabis Hillarii,</hi> unto the said Third Return as aforesaid; And the said Adjournment to be made in the First day of the said <hi>Octabis Hillarii,</hi> commonly called the day of Essoynes. And His Majesty doth hereby declare His fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Will and Pleaure to be, That in the said Term there shall be no Trials by Iuries, or any Iudgement upon Demurrers, or Special Verdicts, in any of His Courts of <hi>Kings-Bench, Common-Pleas,</hi> or <hi>Exchequer.</hi> And that all Matters, Causes, and Suits depending between party and party in His other Courts of <hi>Chancery, Exchequer-Chambers,</hi> or <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> shall have continuance, and the party shall have Day from the Date of these Presents, until the said Third Return as aforesaid. And also, That there shall be no Iudicial Hearings, or determining of any causes, or matters in any of the said Courts of <hi>Chancery, Exchequer-Chambers,</hi> or <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> during the said Term. And His Majesty doth hereby and further Declare, That no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty shall be compelled, or need to appear in person in any of His Majesties said Courts, at any time during the said Term, but may make their appearance by their Attourneys (saving onely in cases of <hi>Outlawry</hi>) and that no Iuries, or any whom the same may concern, shall be compelled, or need to appear in any of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties said Courts at any time during the said Term, for any Cause or Matter whatsoever, unless it be for some special or important Cause for His Majesties service onely.</p>
            <p>And whereas His Majesty having removed the Receipt of His <hi>Exchequer,</hi> together with the <hi>Tally-Office,</hi> and all things thereunto belonging, from <hi>Nonsuch</hi> to <hi>Westminster,</hi> did by His Proclamation of the Fifth of this instant <hi>January,</hi> Direct all Sheriffs, Bayliffs, Collectours, and all other Officers, Accomptants and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whatsoever, who were to pay in any moneys into the said Receipt, or otherwise to attend the same, to keep their days and times at <hi>Westminster</hi> aforesaid, and there to do, pay and perform in all things, as they should or ought to have done, if the said Receipt had not been removed, but there continued; Nevertheless, His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties pleasure is, and He doth hereby Command all Collectors, Receivers, Sheriffs, and other Accomptants, and all other persons that should or ought to accompt in any of His Majesties Courts of <hi>Exchequer,</hi> or <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> or to enter into any Accompt in either of the said Courts, or otherwise to attend the same, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair unto <hi>Windsor</hi> at the time aforesaid, and then and there to Accompt and perform in all things touching their Accompts, as though no such Proclamation or Adjournment had been had or made. And His Majesties further Pleasure and Commandment is, That if any person or persons who ought to Accompt or pay any sum or sums of money to His Majesty in any of the Courts and Places aforesaid, do make Default therein, then His Highness Writs and Process shall be Awarded and sent forth against every such person and persons, and the same to be duely and orderly Served and Returned by the Sheriffs and Officers appointed thereunto, in such manner and form as the same should have been if this Proclamation had not been made: And if any Sheriff or other Officer shall make default, or be negligent in Serving, Executing, or Returning of any the Writs and Process aforesaid, That then every such Sheriff, and other Officer, shall incur such Pains and Penalties, as by the said Courts or any of them, shall be Taxed and Assessed: Willing and Commanding all and every His Majesties Sheriffs; Officers and Subjects to whom it doth or shall appertain, to observe and keep their Assemblies and Appearances, with all their Returns and Certificates, in His Highness said Courts at <hi>Windsor,</hi> in <hi>Crastino Purificationis</hi> next coming, then and there to be holden and kept, and there to do their Offices and Duties in every behalf, in like manner and form as they should or ought to have done, if this present Proclamation had not been had or made, As they will answer the contrary at their perils.</p>
